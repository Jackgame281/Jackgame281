- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jackgame281

- 👀 I’m interested in: Old Technology, indie shows, among other things I will not name.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning: HTML, CSS, Python3, and flexbox.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: Old projects and computer emulation. Nothing crazy for now.

- 📫 How to reach me: Dm me at Discord @jackgame281. You can also find me being rather unhinged on X with the same username.

- 😄 Pronouns: he/him

- ⚡ Fun facts: I shouldn't be given caffeine. I should also mention that my knowledge is also sometimes my own downfall because of the way I am, by not trying certain ways until it's too late. I am wanting to step into C++ sometime in the future, but it's up in the air if I ever will.
